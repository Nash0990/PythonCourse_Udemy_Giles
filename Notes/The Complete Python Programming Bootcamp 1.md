# The Complete Python Programming Bootcamp 1

## Notes: 04 April 2020


### Operations

Addition `3+4`
Subtraction `5-4`
Multiplication `5*4`
Float Division `10/5` output will be `2.0`
Floor Division `10//5` output will be `2`
Power `3**2`


### Print
Simple operation can be run directly in the console, but if you want the output to be printed while running python as script need print command in order to output the results to the `stdout`

`print("This is a print example")`

Example of print function with diiferent escape charachters
`print("One,'two',\"three\",four,\\five\\\n\tonce 'I' caught a fish\n\t\t'//alive\\\\'")`

In order to print 
:::    success
One,'two',"three",four,\five\
    once 'I' caught afish 
        '//alive\\'
:::


Also using print function one can choose how the sentence should end. For example :

```
print("One, Two", end=", ")
print("Three, Four")
```
Would print out
`One, Two, Three, Four`

Inorder to find additional details about a function type `?print` or `help(print)`  to get 
```
